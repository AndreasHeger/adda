OVERVIEW

ADDA is a method to find protein domains in protein sequences.
Briefly, ADDA attempts to split domains into segments that 
correspond as closely as possible to all-on-all pairwise
alignments. A detailed description of the method can be found
in

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

ADDA is controlled with the script adda.py. The script
expects a file adda.ini with configuration options in
the directory from which it is called. An example 
is in the directory ./test.

INPUT DATA

ADDA requires three input files.

   1. sequences in fasta format

   2. the results from an all-on-all sequence comparison (sequence alignment graph)

   3. domain assignments from a reference domain assignment


ADDA proceeds in stages. Each stage corresponds to a command to
the script adda.py. To run all stages, run adda.py as

   python adda.py --steps=all

The specific stages are:

1. Pre-processing of the input. These steps can be performed in
  parallel.

   1. indexing the sequence database - "index"

   2. building sequence profiles - "profiles"

   3. formatting and filtering the alignment graph - "graph"

   4. indexing the alignment graph - "index"

   5. estimating the error parameters - "fit"

2. Decomposing sequences into domains - "optimise"

3. Convert sequence alignment graph to domain alignment graph - "convert"

4. Build minimum spanning tree of domains - "mst"

5. Align domains - "align"
